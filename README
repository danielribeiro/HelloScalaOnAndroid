This is a basic Android project written in Scala.

The interesting part is the build.xml which integrates the Scala compiler and Proguard into the Android build process using Ant.
"ant clean compile install" will build and compile the project and install it on the running Android emulator.

MyAndroidActivity.scala contains the Android activity that is displayed.

Known Issues
============

The Scala activity does not get picked up by Android so a Java activity inherits from it and is the launcher activity instead.
This is not an ideal solution but does have the side effect of demonstrating that it is possible to have a mixed Java / Scala project in Android.
